 File poi_id runs and generates the PLK files asked to do. 
 
 I also created several other files which contain the functions I used on my data analysis
 
 These files are: 
 preliminar_analysis.py
 outliers_analysis.py
 new_features.py
 feature_selection.py
 ml_classifiers.py
 
 I used a Jupyter notebook to do the data analysis and report my results. This file is called ml_project.
